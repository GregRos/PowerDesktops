We need to talk about physical intimacy.

I'm mainly going to be talking about how things stand right now. I don't have any solutions or ideas. I have one or two specific requests and that's it.

I think a big reason I want to say this at all is to clarify things that have been unclear for our entire relationship.

## Me getting hard

If I get hard for any reason, don't comment on it. Just ignore it.

It's an uncontrollable physiological response. I understand you can't stop yourself from looking, but whenever you comment on it I just feel dirty and weird.

## The skip

I feel that the start of our relationship was you being in a very bad place. I ended up making you do things that today I really regret. 

I do apologize for that, but I also understand that I can't change what happened.

I'm not sure how you see that period. But in retrospect, there was an extreme power imbalance that made you unable to say no to whatever I wanted, and I was too blind to see that and made you do things that were wrong on a fundamental level.

To a large extent this power imbalance still exists.

## Responsibility

It's not your responsibility to give me "sexual relief."

The idea that you see me like that and do sexual acts due to feelings of obligation fills me with shame and disgust at myself. It makes me feel like some sort of animal that you need to keep fed.

Maybe you prefer that to me jerking off to porn. I don't know. But to me it's unacceptable.

## Open relationships

You once said something about open relationships.

I'm not interested in that. Even if I were, it's not something that you can actually accept and it would cause both of us severe emotional pain.

## Consent

I can't know if any physical intimacy we have is consensual. 

By that I mean it's something you actually want to engage in and you aren't doing it just to... "give me relief."

I don't even know if you like it when I touch your body. I don't know if you like it when we kiss. I don't know if you like some kisses more than others. 

I don't know if there is anything I can say in a sexual context that you will find positive. 

As far as I can tell, you are not interested in anything beyond kisses with closed lips, and any sexual question or comment or action only puts pressure on you and makes you feel worse.

Based on the things you've told me about your body, I find it hard to imagine any other reality. 

## Current state of things

I've tried to be more physically intimate in the last week or so.

I thought that this might lead to more positive and fulfilling interactions.

I don't feel this is what happened. I have no idea what this has caused you to feel. It seems to have underscored the fact that there is no way I can tell whether you're into something or not.



## Communication

As far as I can tell, communicating about sex or during physical intimacy does not work.

You will tell me whatever I want to hear. 

## Attraction

I don't know if you are attracted to me sexually or feel sexual attraction. 

I don't know what it means for you. 



This means we can't be physically intimate. 

As far as I know, you are not interested in sex, and that the sex we did have was you trying to please me. 

In practice, what ended up happening is that we did not have a period where we learn and understand each other's likes and dislikes.

I ended up picking up on things that you dislike later on and I realized I made you do some of them. 







I'd like to get some stuff off my chest.
